# sync-o-tater
merge two videos into one side-by-side audio-synced 3 d monstrosity.

Requires ffmpeg (with h264 support at the moment)
https://www.ffmpeg.org/

and python 2 for the altered version of clapperless used here
http://users.mur.at/ms/projects/clapperless/
(scipy and nimby needed. python2 based)

and the excellent exiftool

Probably can be compressed into a much more workable beast atsome point with some help.
