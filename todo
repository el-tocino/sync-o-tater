3d Quality:
Clapperless gives sub-frame offsets as decimals, which gives a good indication of the actual suitability of the recordings for 3d. 
The closer the sub-frame offset is to .5 (scale of .00 to .9999), the worse the quality is.  This is not to say it can not be encoded, just that you're having a clear, mid-frame offset to deal with. Higher frame rates make this more acceptable to deal with in the finished project.   I'd be willing to be that a standard deviation curve could be applied to the numbers to indicate the acceptable ranges.

Without genlocked cameras, it's extremely rare to encouter a .00 offset.  

Cleanup of the calculation logic if-then-else ridiculousness:
Making it one bunch of logic to run through for either non-matched start scenario would make things pretty.

Offset-crop parameters:
On super wide angle videos, ala gopros and the like, having a small amount of pixels shifted closer when cropping on both views would likely reduce some of the parallax issues.  Don't overdo it, of course.  

Optional half-frame SBS or T/B encoding:
ala DVD, Bluray, or broadcast 3d.  1920x540 per view, etc.  


Brightness:
calculate/adjust brightness [automagically]?
